# 100days-of-python #100days-of-code
So I am doing a challenge of consistently coding everyday for a 100 days.
Main reason for this is to be consistent and improve on coding skills as this challenge will taking me towards a rewarding journey.
I started on the 6th of October which makes it 23 days of coding. 
Let's GO! NEVER BACK DOWN 💪🙏
